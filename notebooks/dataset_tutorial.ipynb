    "## 🎯 Training Strategy: Using Both Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the documentation and the model training tutorial, here's the optimal strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset 1: SOCOFing (Primary Training)**\n",
    "- **Size**: 6000 fingerprints from 600 subjects (10 fingers each)\n",
    "- **Use**: Primary feature learning and classification training\n",
    "- **Benefits**: \n",
    "  - Large diverse dataset for robust feature representations\n",
    "  - 600 different subjects provides excellent diversity\n",
    "  - Good for learning discriminative fingerprint features\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset 2: Crossmatch (Verification Training)**\n",
    "- **Size**: Multiple impressions of the same finger (up to 8 scans per finger)\n",
    "- **Use**: Verification/matching capability training\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Multiple impressions of same finger perfect for learning intra-class similarity\n",
    "  - Ideal for genuine vs impostor discrimination\n",
    "  - Can be used for validation during training\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommended Training Approach** (from model_training_tutorial.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1**: Train on SOCOFing for feature learning (30 epochs)\n",
    "2. **Phase 2**: Fine-tune on Crossmatch for verification capability (20 epochs)  \n",
    "3. **Phase 3**: Joint training on balanced mix of both (15 epochs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or use the simpler approach shown in the tutorial:\n",
    "- Train primarily on SOCOFing\n",
    "- Use Crossmatch as validation set to monitor verification performance"
